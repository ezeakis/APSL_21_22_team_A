We are CoderDojo Votanikos - CoderDojo Iraq Team A.

This is our program to measure the distinctive ability of the Astro Pi's camera in ISS.

We will take photos of the Earth and we will keep the co-ordinates.

We will base our program on 
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/code-for-your-astro-pi-mission-space-lab-experiment/5

Let's suppose that each photo is 1 MB. Then for 3 GBs we will need 3000 photos.

3 hours are 10800 secs. So we need a photo every 3.6 sec.
